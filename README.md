ShopVR Experimental Projects for PRJ701

Exploring eCommerce in VR with A-Frame and Google Cardboard.

Four slightly different concept interfaces attempting to make the best of a laggy experience.

Version One     -   https://corb65.github.io/ShopVR/
Version Two     -   https://corb65.github.io/ShopVR/v2
Version Three   -   https://corb65.github.io/ShopVR/v3
Version Four    -   https://corb65.github.io/ShopVR/v4

Each uses different techniques and details levels for model loading and navigation. 
Some have basic interactivity added, others don't as the concept was not complete.
